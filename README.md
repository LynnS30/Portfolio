# 🧠 Employee Management System – Final Project (Honors CTP 150)

This project is a Java-based employee management system designed to simulate a real-world business environment involving managers and salespeople. It demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, data modeling, and reporting logic—key skills for both software development and data analytics roles.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The system models a company’s employee structure and provides detailed reporting capabilities. It includes:

- **Abstract classes and interfaces** to define shared and role-specific behaviors
- **Managers** who oversee multiple regions and earn commission based on regional sales
- **Salespeople** who report quarterly sales and earn commission based on performance tiers
- **Utility classes** for calculating commissions and comparing performance
- **Data-driven reporting** including salary breakdowns, sorting, and search functionality

## 🧩 Key Features

- 📁 **Employee Data Modeling**  
  Abstract `Employee` class with subclasses for `Manager` and `Salesperson`

- 📊 **Commission Calculation**  
  Tiered commission structure based on quarterly sales

- 🔍 **Search & Sort Capabilities**  
  - Alphabetical sorting of managers and salespeople  
  - Sorting by total sales and commission  
  - Search by region or last name

- 📄 **Reporting Functions**  
  - Total company sales  
  - Individual salary reports  
  - Region-based performance summaries

- 💾 **Data Persistence**  
  Outputs structured employee data to a file for future use

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (OOP, interfaces, abstract classes)
- File I/O for data persistence
- Comparable interface for custom sorting
- Console-based user interaction

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Applied object-oriented design to simulate real-world business logic
- Implemented polymorphism and abstraction for scalable architecture
- Developed reporting tools that mirror analytical workflows
- Practiced data validation and error handling (e.g., missing employee records)
